First version (only for storing), some unreadable variables and without both order and formatting. 

Under construction, but works. 

You need Lib Aria (version  2.7.2) and MobileSim (to get maps you can download from http://www.inf.ufrgs.br/~prestes/Courses/Robotics/). 


For running, just open the project on QT creator, build and run.
